## SpringyLabs

SpringyLabs is the platform for developers and teams to launch blazingly fast.

## Join The Waitlist

Currently, we are in a beta phase and don't offer the product to the public. But you can [sign up for the waitlist](https://springylabs-41e65.web.app/pricing) and we'll email you a special early-bird pricing before we launch!

## Our Vision

The mission behind SpringyLabs is to create amazing tools for developers and teams to use so they can build and ship awesome products faster at a cheaper price.

## Meet The Team

We have a total of just 2 team members, both being co-founders. Our CEO is Veenit Sheth, a software engineer and content creator from Chicago. Our CTO and other co-founder is Aaryan Soni, a software engineer from Chicago.

## Support
