            <p class="article">The mission behind SpringyLabs is to create amazing tools for developers and teams to use so they can build and ship awesome products faster and at a cheaper price.</p>
            <p class="article">Before we get to the juicy part, let's meet the team. Well, it's not exactly as glamourous as you think. We have a total of just 2 team members, both being co-founders. Our CEO is <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/VeenitXSheth">Veenit Sheth</a>, a software engineer and content creator from Chicago. Our CTO and other co-founder is <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/RuntimeTerror2021">Aaryan Soni</a>, a software engineer from Chicago.</p>
            <p class="article">As of June 2023, we sit at 0 users and a product that is in it's earliest stages. We have no true vision for what is to come and are just trying to get off the ground. We have a valuation of $0 and our budget is less than $50. This will act as a timeline of sorts to see where we started and where we ended up. Our current vision is to build the greatest JavaScript framework to exist, SpringyJS. We think that frameworks in their current state are just confusing and a mess to use. They can also result in massive load-times and be slow for the end-user. But we aim to fix that. SpringyJS will be the simpliest framework to use and have optimization out of the box so your website's can run at their best.</p>
            <p class="article">From there, we plan to build out tools for developers and teams to get the job done efficiently. These tools may include CMS and Web Analytics packages to full Project Management platforms. Our goal is to create the best toolkit a developer could ask for. We may also expand into the world of iOS, Android, or desktop applications in the future.</p>
            <p class="article">And on top of all of this, we plan to keep everything open-source and privacy driven. Every piece of software we create will be viewable on GitHub and certain tools will be open to contributions.</p>
            <p class="article">But this is just the start. Read this blog to stay up-to-date on when we launch, the progress of our products, and what our visions are. We hope to create not only the best suite of developer software out there, but also the greatest developer community in the world.</p>
